|**Provenance** | This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address database design. It is informed by the ICSM's Addressing 2035: Addressing Reform and Innovation for Australia and New Zealand, published in late 2021 and is based primarily on the ISO19160-1 Addressing Part 1: Conceptual model with additional elements from a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models such as GeoSPARQL and SKOS. It is also informed by the relational database model used for the G-NAF, Australia's Geocoded National Address File, and CSIRO work in 2018 to characterise the GNAF in Semantic Web form, the ontology for which is online at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf.
