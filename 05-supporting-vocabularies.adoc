== Supporting Vocabularies

This model uses many vocabularies to give specialised types and roles to classes. This section previews some vocabularies that may be used and links to some others.

This section is not to be taken as normative: these are example vocabularies and, even then, only part of them, to assist with model use.

When implementing this model, it is within the remit of implementation-specific validators to mandate certain vocabularies and perhaps subsets fo concepts within those vocabularies, for use.

=== Vocabularies previewed here

Those defined here are:

* <<Address Part Types>>
* <<Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
* <<Geocode Type>>

NOTE: Hyperlinks to these vocabularies will be provided as soon as persistent identifiers for them are issued. Until then, the content of these vocabularies can be found within the submission to register them: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/icsm-vocabs/pull/13/files.

==== Address Part Types

This vocabulary is an extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s _Address Component Type_ vocabulary. The original 8 concepts from the standard are included below however they are not recommended for use and only shown for comparison.

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

==== Address Lifecycle Stage Types

This vocabulary is currently as per <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressLifecycleStage` vocabulary, however it is expected that this vocabulary will be extended early in its use in Australia/NZ as it is know that jurisdictions within ANZ use other statuses

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

* *https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr-lifeycle-stage-types*

[cols="1,1,2,1"]

This vocabulary was derived from the geocode types given as reference values in the <<GNAF>>.

This is only a partial rendering of the vocabulary - a static list of the top concepts as they were in June, 2023 - provided to give an indicate of values, not to be an exhaustive list of values.

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

=== Links to other vocabularies

At the time of publication, June 2023, there were several vocabularies proposed for publication by this model's authors by the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying & Mapping (ICSM) that were derived from Australian & New Zealand and international addressing standards. Those vocabularies were:

* Flat Types
* Level Types
* Street Suffix Types
* Street Types

Geocode Types is listed in the previous section.

No publication of those vocabularies has yet been assured.
