== Supporting Vocabularies

This model uses many vocabularies to give specific values to classification properties for `Address` and to qualify relationships within the model.

Only three of the vocabularies required for use with this model are detailed here. Others are listed but their details are to be obtained from their independent publication points.

Those detailed here are:

* <<Address Part Types>>
* <<Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
* <<Geocode Types>>

Those published elsewhere and their roles:

* Flat Types
** for use with `flatTypeCode` Address Part Type
** _IRI still to be supplied_
* Level Types
** for use with `levelTypeCode` Address Part Type
** _IRI still to be supplied_


NOTE: Hyperlinks to these vocabularies will be provided as soon as persistent identifiers for them are issued. Until then, the content of these vocabularies can be found within the submission to register them: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/icsm-vocabs/pull/13/files.

=== Address Part Types

This vocabulary fills the role occupied by <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressComponentType` vocabulary and the content is derived from Australian standards and the G-NAF dataset. Original members from <<ISO19160-1>> are listed with notes on what terms from the updated vocabulary to use in their stead. The main logic being that where the original standard expected literal values for components, the new vocabulary expects object which themselves are potentially made of many parts.

=== Address Lifecycle Stage Types

This vocabulary is a slightly extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressLifecycleStage` vocabulary which includes specialise forms of 'current' to cater for official/unofficial addresses.

This vocabulary is expected to be replaced by regional variants per jurisdiction.

=== Geocode Types

This vocabulary indicates the type or the role that a Geocode plays, with respect to the Address. It is expected to be extended.
