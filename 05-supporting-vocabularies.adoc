== Supporting Vocabularies

This model uses many vocabularies to give specialised types and roles to classes. This section previews some vocabularies that may be used and links to some others.

This section is not to be taken as normative: these are example vocabularies and, even then, only part of them, to assist with model use.

When implementing this model, it is within the remit of implementation-specific validators to mandate certain vocabularies and perhaps subsets fo concepts within those vocabularies, for use.

=== Vocabularies previewed here

Those defined here are:

* <<Address Part Types>>
* <<Address Lifecycle Stage Types>>
* <<Geocode Type>>

NOTE: Hyperlinks to these vocabularies will be provided as soon as persistent identifiers for them are issued. Until then, the content of these vocabularies can be found within the submission to register them: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/icsm-vocabs/pull/13/files.

==== Address Part Types

This vocabulary is an extended version of <<ISO19160-1>>'s _Address Component Type_ vocabulary.

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

* *https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr-part-types*

The original 8 concepts from ISO19160-1 are:

|===
| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition | Deprecation note

| `aptiso:addressedObjectIdentifier` | addressed object identifier | Identifier of the addressed object, e.g. building name or address number | Handled by `Address`/`AddressableObject` relation
| `aptiso:administrativeAreaName` | administrative area name | Name of an administrative area | Use `apt:stateOrTerritory`
| `aptiso:countryCode` | country code | ISO 3166-1 code for the country, territory, or area of geopolitical interest | Use `apt:country` to refer to a Country object
| `aptiso:countryName` | country name | Name of a country | Handled by use of `apt:country`
| `aptiso:localityName` | locality name | Name of a locality | Use `apt:locality` to refer to a Locality object
| `aptiso:postOfficeName` | post office name | Name of a post office | Not in current Australian address use
| `aptiso:postcode` | postcode | Code used for the sorting of mail | Use `apt:postcode`
| `aptiso:thoroughfareName` | thoroughfare name | Name of a thoroughfare | Use `apt:road` to refer to a road object
|===

Only the use of `aptiso:postcode` from this list is essentially unchanged as many literal value, such as `countryName`, have been replaced with references to data objects.

This vocab currently (March, 2024) contains the following terms:

|===
| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition | Scope Note

| `apt:geographicalNameObject` | geographical name object | A reference to a geographical name object |
| `apt:propertyName` | propertyName | A name for a property |

| `apt:subaddressNumber` | sub-address number |  | Replaces GNAF's flatNumber
| `apt:subaddressNumberSuffix` | sub-address number suffix |  | Replaces GNAF's flatNumberSuffix
| `apt:buildingLevelType` | building level type |  | Replaces GNAF's levelTypeCode
| `apt:buildingLevelNumber` | building level number |  | Replaces GNAF's levelNumber

| `apt:streetNumberFirst` | street number first |  | Replaces GNAF's numberFirst
| `apt:streetNumberFirstSuffix` | street number first suffix |  | Replaces GNAF's numberFirstSuffix
| `apt:streetNumberLast` | street number last |  | Replaces GNAF's numberLast
| `apt:streetNumberLastSuffix` | street number last suffix |  | Replaces GNAF's numberLastSuffix
| `apt:street` | street | A reference to a Road object | This replaces streetLocality, streetType in GNAF
| `apt:waterFeatureNumber` | water feature number | A number given, based on a water feature numbering system |
| `apt:waterFeatureName` | water feature name | A name given to the water feature |
| `apt:waterFeatureType` | water feature type | A type for the water feature | From a vocabulary: this part is not expected to be printed
| `apt:locality` | locality | A reference to a Locality object |

| `apt:indigenousCountryName` | indigenous country name | The name of an Indigenous country | Could use the above, if the implementing geographical names data includes indigenous country names
|`apt:postcode` | postcode | Code used for the sorting of mail |
| `apt:country` | country | A reference to a country object |
|===

==== Address Lifecycle Stage Types

This vocabulary is currently as per <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressLifecycleStage` vocabulary, however it is expected that this vocabulary will be extended early in its use in Australia/NZ as it is know that jurisdictions within ANZ use other statuses

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

* *https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr-lifeycle-stage-types*

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| IRI | Preferred Label | Definition

| `als:current` | current | The address is recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction and is in use
| `als:reserved` | reserved | The address is recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction but is not yet in use
| `als:retired` | retired | The address was recognised by the authoritative jurisdiction but is not no lonter in use
| `als:proposed` | proposed | The address has been suggested for use but not yet accepted
| `als:rejected` | rejected | The address has been ruled not for use
| `als:unknown` | unknown | The stage of this Address' life is unknown therefore it is assumes as a form of unofficial
|===

==== Geocode Type

This vocabulary was derived from the geocode types given as reference values in the <<GNAF>>.

This is only a partial rendering of the vocabulary - a static list of the top concepts as they were in June, 2023 - provided to give an indicate of values, not to be an exhaustive list of values.

The Persistent web identifier for this vocabulary is:

* *https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geocode-types*

=== Links to other vocabularies

Multiple vocabularies derived from existing standards' codelists and databases' lookup table have been created for use with this model and proposed for adoption in vocabulary form to the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying & Mapping (ICSM). Thos vocabularies, such as _Address Status Type_, _Level Types_ etc. can be seen online at:
