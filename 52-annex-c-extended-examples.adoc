== Annex C: Extended Examples

The extended examples for this model are a series of data files stored in this model's online code repository:

* https://github.com/Spatial-Information-QLD/address-model/tree/main/extended-examples

Each file there exemplifies a modelling situation or problem and the modelling within the data gives this model's solution. The particular situation/problem is explained at the start of each file. For example, in the file locan-01.ttl, we have:

```
# Logan 1
# Multiple Parcels - 1 Address
# 
# Address: 714 Stockleigh Road Stockleigh QLD. Parcels: 378RP849082, 477W31578
# &
# Address: 38 & 40 Augustus Street Kingston. Parcels: 57RP38148 and 57RP38148
```

where `Logan 1` is the example name, `Multiple Parcels - 1 Address` is the scenario descriptor and the remainder the details of the examples in text.

As per the inline examples in this document, all example data is RDF data represented using the Turtle syntax, as per <<Conformance>>.
