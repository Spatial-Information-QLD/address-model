== Introduction

This model considers addresses - 'street addresses' - to be a form of compound name for a geospatial feature. For example, the Australian address:

----
72 Yundah Street
Shorncliffe QLD
4017 Australia
----

is a form of name for the cadastral parcel that defines a particular property's extend - a 'lot'.

Addresses modelled according to this model do more than just name things though: they are linked to geocodes - spatial points - allowing for map-based locating and route planning, sometimes other addresses for the same spatial object, sometimes parent/child addresses for dwelling compounds and management information such as lifecycle stages.

Overall, this model represents addresses, certain properties for them, including components, geocodes and the objects to which addresses are assigned in a conceptual manner similar to the international addressing standard, <<ISO19160-1>>. However, this model is expressed in Semantic Webfootnote:[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web for a general description of the Semantic Web] form, rather than ISO19160-1's UML and XML, and many aspects of the conceptual range that ISO19160 covers this model does not directly cover but instead delegates to other models which it imports, such as the representation of address and address component lifecycle information. This is done so that common things that this model does are available for use elsewhere via a series of mini-models that others may use without importing this whole model.

Additionally, this model relies on several specialised sub-models to handle specific types of address componentry, such as roads and geographical object naming. By doing this, those things many be modelled independently of addressing and roads and geographic object names datasets can be used with address data very easily.

This model makes no attempt to model the things to which addresses are assigned. In the example above, the address "72 Yundah St...." is mentioned as being a form of name for, or assigned to, a cadastral parcel or a 'lot'. This model doesn't know what those things are and leaves their modelling to other systems. This means that using this model alone, you cannot know what an address is for unless you implement a component to describe the type of object the address is assigned to. This decision has been made since there could be great complexity in spatial object / infrastructure modelling that isn't really core to addressing, so that's best left to other, likely sophisticated, models.

=== Sources of Requirements

In 2021, the Australia and New Zealand https://www.icsm.gov.au/[Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping] established an https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035[Addressing 2035 Strategy] that aimed to "provide leadership, coordination and standards for assembling, delivering and maintaining address datasets". The Strategy listed "Strategic Pillars", such as "Jurisdictional flexibility" - things for Strategy implementers to aim for - "Guiding Principles", "Overarching Pain Points" and other system/model/situation requirements. While the Strategy did not present an address model, it had an addendum that listed 10 requirements for a future address data model: https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-strategy-information-addendum[Addendum to the Strategy]. These 10 requirements are a major source of this Address Models requirements.

These ICSM requirements include both specific requirements, for example to cater for "Multi-lingual and alternate name addressing", and also requirements to align with other address-related initiative which might be a source of multiple individual requirements, for example "Model interoperability" which, in its detailed description, indicates a requirement for an address model to align with a baseline set of spatial data standards that ICSM might create.

<<AnnexA>> lists the ICSM Addressing 2035 Strategy Addendum's 10 requirements and indicates how this model implements solutions for them.

=== Major Modelling Principles

Major modelling principles present in this model are:

. <<Feature / Feature Naming differentiation>>
. <<Feature / Geometry differentiation>>
. <<Geocodes>>
. <<Road & Geographical Object Names>>
. <<Address component grouping>>
. <<Water Addressing>>
. <<Related Addresses>>
. <<Lifecycles>>
. <<Profile Views>>

These principles are explained in the following subsections and the first two reference the following figure.

==== Feature / Feature Naming differentiation

This model details the elements of an _address_ but not details of the spatial objects that addresses are assigned to. The general conceptual split of address/spatial object follows the Address/AddressableObject split in ISO19160-1 <<ISO19160-1>>. Addresses are seen as a form of complex, multi-part, label - Feature Label - for a spatial Feature.

This allows for the representation, and ultimately the management, of labels - text, numbers, identifiers, references - separately to the management of spatial objects.

This Feature / Feature Naming separation applies to Place Names, Roads and Administrative Areas as well as Addresses and this expression of Feature / Feature Naming separation for addressing is a formal profile of the more general _Compound Naming Model_ <<CNM>>. There are other profiles for those other domains. The FLM, this model and the other FLM profiles are all pat of Queensland Spatial Information's https://spatial-information-qld.github.io/supermodel/supermodel.html[_Supermodel_] which is an enterprise data model for multi-model data integration.

==== Feature / Geometry differentiation

(Geo)spatial objects referenced by this model are not geometries but conceptual spatial objects that have as an expression of their spatial projection one or more geometries. This conceptual object - Feature - and spatial expression - Geometry - split is based on fundamental spatial modelling in standards such as <<ISO19101-1>> and their expression in the Semantic Web spatial standard <<GEO>>.

This Feature / Geometry distinction allows individual spatial objects to have multiple Geometries: different resolutions, in different coordinate systems and even sets of Geometries that have different roles or that show variation over time.

==== Geocodes

Geocodes are point geometries associated with an address that can be used by mapping applications to locate the address, or part of an addressable object, on a map.

Since geocodes are directly related to an Address and are only indirectly related to an Addressable Object, in this model they are modelled as a specialised form of Features with a Geometry used to indicate the point location. The Address relates to the Geocode in a similar way to an Address relating to an Addressable Object however the Address isn't the address _for_ the Addressable Object but rather the Geocode is another kind of object associated with the Address with a _role_ indicated, e.g. a particular Geocode might indicate the "property centroid", or perhaps it's the "deliveries point" of a large building address.

==== Profile Views

Addresses have multiple roles: they indicate places with names (or Features with Labels), they are things to be managed by data holders, and they have statuses, lifecycles and so on. Sometimes we are only interested in one of these aspects of an Address or one _profile_ and not the total Address information held. We may also be interested only in a reduced set of properties of an Address even when others within that role are present, e.g. the current status, not all the statues an Address has ever had. Finally, different implementers of this model may want to implement different jurisdictional profiles of the entire model that, for example, mandate records for that jurisdiction's system's use of Addresses that would be meaningless outside that jurisdiction.

All of these sorts of _profiles_ of Addresses are handled in a similar way in this model: they are declared Profiles of the model that may implement additional rules and/or requirements on data, however they must always conform to the main Address Model itself.

Profile modelling is given in <<PROF>> and requesting profiles from data conforming to a model is given in <<CONNEGP>>.
