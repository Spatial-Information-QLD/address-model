== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some of the properties are restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with golbal identity, that can be used in isolation as well as together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines only three Classes and no Properties but reuses many Classes and Properties from other models. Where it does, basic details of, a reference to that Class or Properties' definition via `rdfs:isDefinedBy`, and a scope note about using it in this model are given.

[[AddressableObject]]
==== Addressable Object

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `addr:AddressableObject`
| Preferred Label | Addressable Object
| Definition | An object that is unambiguously identified by an address.

Examples of types of AddressableObjects are a building, a dwelling or a land parcel
| Is Defined By | This model
| Sub-class Of | https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_class_geofeature[`geo:Feature`]
| Provenance | Derived from <<ISO19160-1>>'s `AddressableObject` class and its associated codelist of subtypes
| Scope note | Judgement as to what makes for a permissible AddressableObject rests with the implementer. This model's technical requirements are only that the object is a legal `geo:Feature` object, thus implementers may make Addressable Objects of almost anything.
| Expected Properties | <<hasAddress>>, http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#[`geo:hasGeometry`]
| Example 
a| [source,turtle]
----
# ex:parcel-x is inferred to be an Addressable object
# due to the property addr:hasAddress indicated for it

| Preferred Label | has value
| Definition | Indicates the textual rendering of an Address Component
| Scope note | This property is to be used to represent the textual value of Address Components that are literals and also complex objects. For a literal, the same value will be present for hasValue and hasValueText, e.g. a street number of 20 or a property name of "Bonnie Doon", however for a complex object, e.g. the locality `<http://example.com/lga/1234>`, a textual representation of it must be selected. Likely a simple name for the object will do, i.e. a Locality name or a Street Locality name.
