== Preamble

=== Abstract

[NOTE]
This Model is under test by Queensland Government and is a candidate model for Australian & New Zealand address information. It is currently an unofficial model that is not yet published as a standard.

A Semantic Web data model of address information. It caters specifically for Australian & New Zealand's address modelling needs. It was made in 2022 for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address database design. It is informed by the ICSM's Addressing 2035: Addressing Reform and Innovation for Australia and New Zealand, published in late 2021 and is based primarily on the ISO19160-1 _Addressing Part 1: Conceptual model_ <<ISO19160-1>> with additional elements from a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models such as GeoSPARQL <<GEO>> and SKOS <<SKOS>>. It is also informed by the relational database model used for the https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/d4631917-14d7-4c49-830c-555ad63adf9d[G-NAF, Australia's Geocoded National Address File], and CSIRO work in 2018 to characterise the GNAF in Semantic Web form, the ontology for which is online at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variatey of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used throughout this document, are listed below.

=== Conformance

This model conforms to the https://w3id.org/profile/ontpub[OntPub Profile] which is a specification for ontology publication that mandates certain structural and metadata properties for the model as a whole and model elements. Metadata elements for the model as a whole - the ontology - are given in the <<Metadata>> section above.
